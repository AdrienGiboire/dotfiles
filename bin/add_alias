# update_alias
#
# In order to optimize our productivity, aliases are great for those who spend lot
# of time in their terminal. Yet, people tend to diminish the greatness of aliases.
# They tend to say it's too much time to create/maintain them. However, there is a lot
# of things you enter more than once a day. These things, as fast as they might be to type,
# would be even more faster if you used aliases.
#
# So, as a bearded terminal guy, I wrote this little piece of code to make alias creation fast
# and easy.
#
# USAGE
#
# Run:
# $ update_alias \
#   -aa <alias_name> \
#   -ac <alias_command> \
#   -p <alias_file_path>
#
# Where:
#   <alias_name> is the alias name
#   <alias_command> is the alias command
#   <alias_file_path> is the file containing the aliases. Default is "$HOME/.zshrc"
#
