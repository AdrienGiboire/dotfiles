## Install

*Note:* If you're running Ubuntu, replace `sh` with `bash` as Ubuntu comes with `dash` which will raise syntax error while running `install` script.

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/AdrienGiboire/dotfiles/master/scripts/install | sh
```

### Update
```
cd ~
./.dotfiles/scripts/update
```
